++++ Listing folders
All foldernames are presented between brackets like [X] where X is the foldername.
When a foldername contains non-ASCII characters it is presented in the form
[X] = [Y] where
X is the imap foldername you have to use in command line options and
Y is the utf8 output just printed for convenience, to recognize it.

Host1: folders list (first the raw imap format then the [X] = [Y]):

Checking SEARCH ALL works on both accounts. To avoid that check, use --nochecknoabletosearch
Host1: checking if SEARCH ALL works on INBOX
Host1: folder [INBOX] has 2 messages mentioned by SELECT
Host1: folder [INBOX] has 2 messages found by SEARCH ALL
Host1: folder [INBOX] has the same messages count (2) by SELECT and SEARCH ALL
Host2: checking if SEARCH ALL works on INBOX
Host2: folder [INBOX] has 1 messages mentioned by SELECT
Host2: folder [INBOX] has 1 messages found by SEARCH ALL
Host2: folder [INBOX] has the same messages count (1) by SELECT and SEARCH ALL
Good! SEARCH ALL works on both accounts.

Folders sizes before the synchronization. It can take some time. Be patient.
You can remove foldersizes listings by using "--nofoldersizes" and "--nofoldersizesatend"
but then you will also lose the ETA (Estimation Time of Arrival) given after each message copy.
