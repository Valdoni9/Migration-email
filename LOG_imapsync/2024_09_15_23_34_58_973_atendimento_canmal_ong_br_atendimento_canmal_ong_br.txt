Host1: folder [INBOX] has the same messages count (4) by SELECT and SEARCH ALL
Host2: checking if SEARCH ALL works on INBOX
Host2: folder [INBOX] has 1 messages mentioned by SELECT
Host2: folder [INBOX] has 1 messages found by SEARCH ALL

Good! SEARCH ALL works on both accounts.

Folders sizes before the synchronization. It can take some time. Be patient.
You can remove foldersizes listings by using "--nofoldersizes" and "--nofoldersizesatend"
but then you will also lose the ETA (Estimation Time of Arrival) given after each message copy.
